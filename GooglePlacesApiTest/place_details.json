Much too often, appetizers from restaurants can be as big as the main entree. 4-5 chicken pieces with an excellent peanut sauce. Highly recommend. I ordered the crispy orange chicken. Not much different from any other orange chicken. It was good, but nothing to really write home about. Outside skin crispy and with the rice, made for a good meal. I ordered the giant fortune cookie for dessert. Fruit is always a good idea for dessert. I usually get stuffed from the appetizer and entree, and any heavy chocolate is overbearing. The fortune cookie contains a fortune (yes, shocker I know) and is split between vanilla cream on one side and chocolate on the other. Along with the thick walls of the cookie, this made eating the desert easy and enjoyable. Also highly recommend. Now, I usually don't get tea after a meal however,  TAO had some flavored teas (I believe I tried peach flavor) which went excellently as the finisher to the meal.

Enough TVs to entertain a sports fan, but not enough to be defined as a sports bar and that\u2019s not a bad thing because that\u2019s not where this establishment is meant to shine. \n\nThe food is the real deal people! With the usual suspects of classic Irish fare on the menu we decided to go with the classic fish & chips and a traditional beef stew prepared in Guinness. \n\nThe Irish bread is fresh and crumbles with annoying authenticity at the attempt to spread butter.\n\nThe fish (Cod like the good lord intended) and chips were spot on. Flaky and white encased in a crispy yet light batter that lets the fresh fish fall apart when broken is without fault. Chips (aka: French Fries) are prepared perfectly with the correct amount of crunch. \n\nMy stew was hearty with a flavor profile that puts most American stews to shame. Tender morsels of meat, potatoes that were added at just the right time to soak in that deliciously thick Guinness broth while maintaining their texture and form. Carrots, celery, onions, et al all working in a harmonious balance that quite literally left me wanting to let it saturate my taste buds a little longer than normal. Then the addition of peas that gave a little pop of flavor with each chew were far more than an afterthought.\n\nService was also excellent and the draft Guinness did not disappoint.\n\nWell done mates, well done indeed!"}, {"text": "Unplanned visit to a really cool place.

Building itself is nice, clean, bar-like atmosphere.\n\nBesides the food being just fair, what makes me give such a poor review was the service. Clearly they hired the young man for his Irish accent alone.  He never once checked back on us and we all needed refills.  Never offered dessert or coffee, which we all would have been up for.  I had to flag him down for our check even though we had all stopped eating a good 15 minutes prior and he almost seemed annoyed that I requested it.  No \" how was everything\" , no offer for tea, coffee etc.  Can't even tell you his name because he never said it.\n\nAnd it was not busy, as it was an off hour (2 p.m.)  so that can't be the reason.  I honestly think he had no serving experience and was hired for the accent alone.  \n\nPlenty other Irish pubs around.

If you are a single, you can't sit at a table, but must sit at a counter. I think the tables are communal. Got sat at a very awkward counter that was a corner and rounded, so I was sticking way out. It is hard to get your waiters attention when sitting at a counter also.  Generally, love Todd English restaurants, and have been to many of them. Not sure about this one. Ordered the rigatoni bolognese. The bowl it comes in makes it feel very small, compared to when you see this sprawling salad served to the person next to you. The bolognese sauce is interesting in flavor....tastes like maybe there is nutmeg or something a little non traditional in it.  It was good, but the flavor is a bit tinny, reminding me of spaghettios, and didn't have a rich tomato bolognese flavor like many others I've had in my lifetime. Also, this bowl of pasta will set you back $17, and this is at lunch time.

What upset us even more is that the fact that we were not even notified at all that our stripper was not coming tonight. We waited until 11:28pm to inquire since you did indicate 10:30-11:30 but knowing that he will not show up and not receiving any courtesy call is beyond unacceptable.  In today\u2019s age I am fairly sure that the individual that was coming to our party had a cell phone. It would have been at least a courtesy if we got a call saying that he is late or apologize for not coming due to a car issue. But instead we received such rude behavior. I called at least 4 times and no confirmation or update if someone was indeed coming. The third time I called someone picked up and told me just email us since he cannot deal with me right now since it is too loud and hanged up.

We contacted Shaun the owner weeks in advance to reserve the Red Room (private room) for our celebration, and he confirmed. When we arrived on the night of our party, it turns out he booked another party in that room, and reserved the open space of the bar in the front for us instead. The fact that we had confirmed these details in the previous weeks to find that he had \u2018confused\u2019 his communication with another party was extremely disappointing. In fact, we chose to celebrate our birthday here because of the separate and private space\u2026\n\nWhile Shaun did apologize and offered us a complimentary bottle of rose, it still kind of sucked that this happened. Since the room was booked until 11pm, there was nothing we could do but hang out in the open area instead and make the most of it.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t really like was that Shaun kept trying to advocate for the shared space in the main part of the bar as the \u2019sought out\u2019 area of the bar. The reason we wanted the private room was because it was a private space, and the seating arrangement was a bit better - not as spaced out as the open area room (which has couches here and there, and not everyone could sit.) Also, my friend visited the bar a few weeks in advance to check out the space - and preferred The Red Room, which also influenced our decision to book this room.\n\nRegarding drinks, cocktail drinks are GOOD (~15 each). My friends ordered this punch with a flame, it was very tasty. However, my friends pointed out that the bartender was judgmental when they asked for a Long Island Iced Tea\u2026.\n\nEven though we were pretty disappointed that we could not get the private space when we had reserved it in advance, we were still able to have a good time. Also they did not charge a cake fee, which was nice and we were able to store it in their fridge.

This business could have done some positive alignment with a very popular TV show and blew it.  First they 1) advertised a special VIP entrance  if you texted or tweeted them.  It would be free if you entered before 11:30.  However, at 11:05, the line was around the block and when security staff was questioned about the promotion and shown the text message, I was sent to the back of the line with a smirk.  Later the line was solicited regularly by bouncers whose palms you could cross with $25-$40 to get to the front of the line, only to pay the cover charge ALSO upon entry.  \n\nAfter an hour and a half in line and explaining to the staff more than once that I was press AND was also on one of the performers' guestlists, I handed my business card to the people ahead of me in line when we started talking about my press cred.  THEY flagged a bouncer and explained the situation.  After an HOUR AND A HALF of standing on 8th Ave, I was finally ushered into the club by a ?manager\" with many apologies.  However, when I got inside and explained to the man at the desk that I was actually on a guestlist I was still soaked for FORTY DOLLARS.  \n\nFor my 40 samolians, I got one number from each of the headliners after waiting almost 3 hours for them to go on.  During that time I tried to find a spot to be comfortable, wandering over a sticky floor and being shoved by more than one aggressive patron who apparently failed to notice I'm not a teenager.  In fact I'm well over 35 so I don't push back too well. \n\nAfter the show, the complete lack of organization continued with security shoving me back up against the bar and continuing to tell me to move back.  Um honey that bar ain't goin' nowhere.  Then the way they directed the people in line?  I just kept getting pushed back further.  So I didn't get to thank the person who invited me & put me on their list.  The ?manager? did check in with me a few times during the night and I admit I failed to tell him about the $40 cover.  But he did nothing to insure that I connected with people there that I should have been given much easier access to.  \n\nIn short, I will never go back."}, {"text": "Am from bk nd razors its not a gay club but they take u likr u r check it out"}], "types": ["night_club", "point_of_interest", "establishment"], "url": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=12801489029709971593", "user_ratings_total": 13}, {"formatted_address": "132 Greene Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11238, USA", "formatted_phone_number": "(718) 576-3584", "geometry": {"location": {"lat": 40.6864566, "lng": -73.9666467}}, "name": "Mayflower", "price_level": 2, "rating": 4.5, "reviews": [{"text": "Great, low key neighborhood spot for excellent cocktails.

Must try! Pleasant prices! Vegan and meat!)"}, {"text": "Quite possibly the best Ethiopian place you can find, for more than one reason. First of all: It's not just authentic and tasty, it's also some of the bigger (and hence more fairly priced) portions I've had in any NYC Ethiopian restaurant. For some reason other places skimp out like crazy. Secondly: They have a wider selection of (again) authentic Ethiopian beers. Other places have few and widen the selection with trashy US beer. Third: The wine list is extremely well currated (with actual Ethiopian options) and fitted to the taste and range of a good menu. Awash gets extra points from this dude for having a balanced space with balanced lighting and music volume. Atmosphere! Brooklyn restaurants, it f###### counts! Many other restaurants could take a cue or two from this place. Staff is above and beyond, always nice and on point. Such a pleasant experience. Remember to get the house-made chili-paste/sauce side! Brilliant!"}, {"text": "This place is legit! Such great flavors and the staff is really nice. There were three of us and we got both the vegan and meat samplers and that was plenty of food (plus we got to try almost everything, which was awesome). The beef and the red lentils were my faves but really enjoyed eating everything! Also, the frog tiles in their restroom are just adorable. Love this place, highly recommended!"}, {"text": "This was the first time eating Ethiopian food and to my amazement it was absolutely amazing. The establishment shows the theme throughout with nice artwork and the drinks were really good. I tried the rough rider (although it came in a smaller glass then I expected it packed a punch.) The food was 9 out of 10.  I think I'm giving a 9 because I ordered the steak tartar which specified on the menu that u can get it raw medium or well done and the waitress never asked how we wanted it...and it totally slipped my mind. So we got raw ground steak which tasted lightly cooked but not enough. All in all I loved it and will be going back soon."}], "types": ["art_gallery", "bar", "restaurant", "food", "point_of_interest", "establishment"], "url": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=12958713688338228372", "user_ratings_total": 267}, {"formatted_address": "221 W 38th St #2, New York, NY 10018, USA", "formatted_phone_number": "(212) 944-7792", "geometry": {"location": {"lat": 40.754012, "lng": -73.989521}}, "name": "Lazzara's Pizza Cafe", "rating": 4.2, "reviews": [{"text": "Maybe it\u2019s pizza that\u2019s just right up my ally, maybe it was we had their first pie of the day.

Every part of our day went spectacularly, exceeding our expectations, and a HUGE part of that was because of this venue and all the staff that make the place run smoothly, professionally, and joyfully.  I cannot tell you how many texts, emails, and voicemails we received afterwards telling us this was the best wedding they've ever been to.  How fun it was.  How the layout made it so cool and extra special.  They loved that dancing was separate, making that portion a real party.  And for the guests who don't really want to be out there dancing, they still felt like they were a part of it since the tables are right there in the action.  It was a dream. \nAlso, you will LOVE your experience at Deity as much as your guests did!  A few more specifics about our day, as I know I read all these reviews in detail when deciding; we started the day in the Suite getting ready, which was such a beautiful landing space to have.  It is GORGEOUS and just makes you feel luxurious and taken care of immediately.  The staff were checking in all day or answering texts about tiny questions.  And it was so nice to be whisked away up there at various points in the night for some connection time between you alone as a couple.  I think this aspect is something that sets Deity completely apart.  On the night of your event you are given TWO coordinators who are pretty much just there for you.  They keep track of timing and where you two need to be at any point in the night and just allowed us to be more fully present in every moment, not worrying over \"what time is it?  is xyz happening?\" At any moment I had a question or a thought, they were two steps ahead of me and I relaxed all the more, breathing a deep sigh of relief and gratitude.  Beyond these two amazing coordinators, there's the whole rest of the staff, who are also so kind, considerate, and on top of every little thing.  We had two people who were in a wheelchair or walker.  This was something that caused us a lot of concern beforehand, but Caio assured us they knew exactly how to handle it and to not worry.  And man were they right.  With grace, poise, and open hearts, they maneuvered the wheelchair over various steps, and aided with the chair lift.  My 96 year old grandma said she felt like royalty. They then went above and beyond when at the start of dancing, our wheelchair bound uncle couldn't get a cab as it was New Year's Eve, and the bartender himself walked him and his wife to the hotel!  When we heard of this the next morning, we teared up.  It was that level of kindness and consideration at every point, big and small, that sets this venue apart from all the rest.  \nThe food and drinks were plentiful and absolutely delicious (the salmon and short ribs are to die for) and kept us happy dancing into the night. Not to mention the GORGEOUS interior and design on every floor.  I loved it from the first time I set eyes on the place, and every guest commented how cool, unique, fun, and well-done our wedding was.  This was because of the team at Deity, not us.  ; )"}, {"text": "A beautiful place. I went there for a wedding and it was perfection. I loved the layout of the cocktail lounge, the ceremony/dining hall, and even the dance floor. It may be small but for a hidden gem in Brooklyn it has great atmosphere."}, {"text": "After we got engaged, we knew that finding a venue would be the first thing we needed to do. The venue really helps set the tone of how the event will come together. The owner of Deity, Caio, actually called us personally to follow up on our intake form. This simple act of such dedication and sincerity for his business was a refreshing surprise! We promptly set up time to tour the venue, which Caio promised to show us personally.\n\nIt was during that tour that the deal was really solidified. My now husband and I feel strongly about personal connections, and we felt that immediately with Caio. He had such a warm personality. We knew that we could trust him, and that this event would be taken personally as a reflection of his promise. It really made picking Deity a no brainer and we quickly locked in a date, and we are SO GLAD that we did. \n\nEverything, at every step and turn was truly amazing. I emailed Deity countless times with big and small questions. I am a huge planner, and needed to have every single detail sorted out, and the Deity staff was essentially my wedding planning co-team, it was an incredible partnership! They were more than helpful every step of the way, and even added additional advice whenever they could. When you\u2019re spending so much money, its difficult to feel at ease, or like you can really trust the process, but we really felt that way with Deity from the time we met Ciao, and especially on our wedding day.\n\nAnd this is all in the lead up to the event! The day-of was so smooth it was almost hard to believe that everything went off so incredibly seamlessly. The entire staff knew exactly what to do, when to do it, and how to handle every single aspect of our special day. We had a timeline to keep to, and they kept everyone on time without us feeling rushed or stressed. Whenever we needed something, or had a question that day, one of our 2 attendees were there to help, making it is so we could really just focus on the day, and the moment. \n\nThere is so much more that we could say, from helping us take special moments for ourselves, to the food and the incredible service, we could keep going on and on!! Truly, from the bottom of our hearts, thank you so much for making the day everything we could have imagined, and even more!!"}, {"text": "When ask about the venue, no response when i finally spoke to someone they were rude..."}], "types": ["bar", "food", "point_of_interest", "establishment"], "url": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=13667903410076053277", "user_ratings_total": 150}, {"formatted_address": "10 Columbus Cir, New York, NY 10019, USA", "formatted_phone_number": "(347) 682-2100", "geometry": {"location": {"lat": 40.76847, "lng": -73.983092}}, "name": "Bluebird London NYC", "rating": 4.1, "reviews": [{"text": "The restaurant is gorgeous.

I chose two different drinks from the \"STIRRED BOOZY AND SERIOUS\" section and both of them were brilliant. Would highly  recommend \"BIRDS OF A FEATHER\" was a blend of Rum, Vermouth, Vanilla and Cinnamon and\"NIGHT TIME AFFAIR\" which had Gin, Vermouth and Absinthe and was served in a Goblet\n\nService:\nOur server carefully explained the different nuances of each section and recommended drinks that would suit our tastes and preferences while answering any questions about the menu. .The service was fast and prompt as well although the drinks might feel a tad overpriced at $16 per drink,\n\nAll in all,  a wonderful experience.
