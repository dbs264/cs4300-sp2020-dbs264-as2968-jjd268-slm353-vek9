I really enjoyed this. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and was flavorul. The BBQ with the grits was a different and welcome update to a classic. The mimosas just taste like your typical brunch mimosa - nothing to write home about.\n\nFor brunch, it can be a little pricey if you don't have a Pulsd deal.

We asked the server why don't we see that item on the menu?  He told us that the menu for the \"bar area\" was different than for the \"dining area\".  \n\nThe \"bar area\" was a few elevated seats with individual, taller tables (not an actual bar), about 5 feet away from where we were currently seated.  The tables were empty.  \n\nBasically - they wouldn't serve us a burger (or any item from the other menu) unless we moved to the taller tables... we asked if we could move to the tables then, and the server said \"for a burger?!\" in a condescending tone.  \n\nBut one of our friends wanted the pasta from the \"dining area\" menu... so they wouldn't serve us that if we moved to the taller tables.  It was just a ridiculous thing to experience and I don't seem to \"get it\" I guess this place is just too fancy for us plebeians.\n\nAnyway, the food itself wasn't great.  The quality of the food was good, but the way it was prepared wasn't.  Scallops had sand in them, the broccoli was burnt, some of the food was over salted / over peppered. \n\nI feel like they could tell something was off since they offered us a complimentary octopus dish.  This was nice since many places don't recognize or attempt to alleviate awkward situations.  We really appreciated this gesture.  \n\nThe server also asked us how our food was on multiple occasions and how everything was going - to which admittedly, we said everything was fine to.

Food was an absolute night mare. Appetizers were 2/5. Tuna tart was okay and shrimp was good. There was some triangular appetizer we ordered, best to stay away from it. As for the Main courses the steak was so dry, it was torture to eat it. The 1/2 chicken had no seasoning and was extremely dry. And customer service, the young lady serving us was absolutely rude, when she asked if everything is okay I pointed out that all the meats served are very dry and she ignored me. Not even an acknowledgement. If the waitress treated us with more respect and tried to help fix the food my ratings my have gotten higher but she truly could not care less. \nAlso we went in the intention of a birthday and I informed the waiters it is a surprise yet this same lady came back to the table making a blunt announcement to the person we are trying to surprise. \u201cDO YOU WANT THE CAKE NOW\u201d.

The person who answered was very professional, friendly, and polite. Gave me all information that I wanted to know. \n\nI arrived on a Saturday Night and, was \"sincerely\" greeted by every person who I came in contact with. I was seated by the host and although it took me a while to order, I was always being checked on every 2-3 mins. \n\nIt was my first time in a Moroccan Restaurant, and what was recommended to me was everything I was hoping for to taste! I had the \"only Moroccan Red Wine\" which was AMAZING! \n\nAnd had the Lamb Shank which I TOTALLY RECOMMEND, and the Couscous with Vegetables and Lamb. Portions were ON-POINT, Flavors were exotically delicious. \n\nThere was a Belly Dancer who was SUPER ENTERTAINING and seemed to dance by PASSION! She tried to get the guests involved and dance with her. LOVED IT! Just wish it was for more than 30mins. \n\nAfterwards, there was a singer with a Moroccan style guitar which was who really made me just want to buy another bottle of wine and stayed practically ALL NIGHT! Had I not been dancing for almost the entire time being there, I would've ordered some appetizers to pick on. But that wine was just so good that I ended up just ordering another bottle instead of food. Oh well, it gives me another reason on top of the MANY REASONS, to return. By the way, the ambience was EXCELLENT as well. \n\nI cannot stress enough how much fun this place was. I also cannot compare ANY OTHER RESTAURANT (yet) in NYC that could possibly be close to better than Arabesque (generally speaking)."}], "types": ["night_club", "bar", "restaurant", "food", "point_of_interest", "establishment"], "url": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=18393041897663098784", "user_ratings_total": 514}, {"formatted_address": "145 W 45th St, New York, NY 10036, USA", "formatted_phone_number": "(212) 840-6688", "geometry": {"location": {"lat": 40.7576169, "lng": -73.9843645}}, "name": "O'Lunney's", "price_level": 2, "rating": 4.4, "reviews": [{"text": "This place is the one I always prefer.

Enough TVs to entertain a sports fan, but not enough to be defined as a sports bar and that\u2019s not a bad thing because that\u2019s not where this establishment is meant to shine. \n\nThe food is the real deal people! With the usual suspects of classic Irish fare on the menu we decided to go with the classic fish & chips and a traditional beef stew prepared in Guinness. \n\nThe Irish bread is fresh and crumbles with annoying authenticity at the attempt to spread butter.\n\nThe fish (Cod like the good lord intended) and chips were spot on. Flaky and white encased in a crispy yet light batter that lets the fresh fish fall apart when broken is without fault. Chips (aka: French Fries) are prepared perfectly with the correct amount of crunch. \n\nMy stew was hearty with a flavor profile that puts most American stews to shame. Tender morsels of meat, potatoes that were added at just the right time to soak in that deliciously thick Guinness broth while maintaining their texture and form. Carrots, celery, onions, et al all working in a harmonious balance that quite literally left me wanting to let it saturate my taste buds a little longer than normal. Then the addition of peas that gave a little pop of flavor with each chew were far more than an afterthought.\n\nService was also excellent and the draft Guinness did not disappoint.\n\nWell done mates, well done indeed!"}, {"text": "Unplanned visit to a really cool place.

Clearly they hired the young man for his Irish accent alone.  He never once checked back on us and we all needed refills.  Never offered dessert or coffee, which we all would have been up for.  I had to flag him down for our check even though we had all stopped eating a good 15 minutes prior and he almost seemed annoyed that I requested it.  No \" how was everything\" , no offer for tea, coffee etc.  Can't even tell you his name because he never said it.\n\nAnd it was not busy, as it was an off hour (2 p.m.)  so that can't be the reason.

We contacted Shaun the owner weeks in advance to reserve the Red Room (private room) for our celebration, and he confirmed. When we arrived on the night of our party, it turns out he booked another party in that room, and reserved the open space of the bar in the front for us instead. The fact that we had confirmed these details in the previous weeks to find that he had \u2018confused\u2019 his communication with another party was extremely disappointing. In fact, we chose to celebrate our birthday here because of the separate and private space\u2026\n\nWhile Shaun did apologize and offered us a complimentary bottle of rose, it still kind of sucked that this happened. Since the room was booked until 11pm, there was nothing we could do but hang out in the open area instead and make the most of it.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t really like was that Shaun kept trying to advocate for the shared space in the main part of the bar as the \u2019sought out\u2019 area of the bar. The reason we wanted the private room was because it was a private space, and the seating arrangement was a bit better - not as spaced out as the open area room (which has couches here and there, and not everyone could sit.) Also, my friend visited the bar a few weeks in advance to check out the space - and preferred The Red Room, which also influenced our decision to book this room.\n\nRegarding drinks, cocktail drinks are GOOD (~15 each). My friends ordered this punch with a flame, it was very tasty. However, my friends pointed out that the bartender was judgmental when they asked for a Long Island Iced Tea\u2026.\n\nEven though we were pretty disappointed that we could not get the private space when we had reserved it in advance, we were still able to have a good time. Also they did not charge a cake fee, which was nice and we were able to store it in their fridge.

Almost every angle of this restaurant is Instagram worthy.\n\nDoes the food live up to the d\u00e9cor?  YES!  So happy we got to come for a food tasting.  We ordered quite a lot of food (for two people) when we were here. We ordered the fried pork buns, roasted eggplants, scallion oil noodles, pineapple fried rice with shrimp and the veggie summer roll. \n\nThe fried pork buns were amazing.  The braised pork belly melts in your mouth.  This was by far my favorite dish of the night.  The roasted eggplants were another great dish.  The soybean paste and bonito flakes really helped to elevated the eggplants.  The pineapple fried rice was great and I loved the shredded pork garnish.  The scallion oil noodles had great flavor.  The dish was smaller than I was expecting but the noodles were wonderful.  Cooked right and not overdone.  The summer roll was okay.  We ordered it because it looked like it was a new addition to the menu.  I think this dish was overshadowed by the fried buns and roasted eggplants. \n\nWe also ordered desserts and got the fried buns with condensed milk and a scoop of the lychee ice cream.  The lychee ice cream was surprisingly forgettable, but the fried buns were a winner.  It had a thin coating of caramelized sugar and had a nice crunch as you bit into it.  It did not need the condensed milk dip, in my opinion. \n\nI definitely want to go back and try more of their menu.

The caramel sauce and hazelnuts are good but the dough is exceedingly salty. Almost like pretzel dough. Sort of strange. We also ordered the Lobster roll (which I liked but my husband, who likes lobster, could have done without all the extra seasoning and toppings) a burger (which was good but impossible to eat because the bottom bun was mush) and a fried chicken sandwich that was okay. I will say that the turmeric quinoa dish is delightful, if that is your jam. It does have cauliflower and cherries in it and my husband couldn't have been LESS impressed if he tried.

My friend got the Prosciutto pizza. For my taste buds the spaghetti noodles were al dente perfect! While the sauce left much to be admired. I felt it was a bit on the watery and bland side. Probably the cherry tomatoes made for a more watery like sauce?  To stave off the watery blandness, I added some parmigiano cheese in hopes it will solve the salt issue to no affect. Then again, I like my salt! So for all I know the salt level was probably as high as a salt tank but my taste buds are desensitize to it. The lemonade was on point.

The rice on the side was over cooked and dry. I took 2 bites of the soppy, wet, mush and couldn't finish it. I did not like the texture or the taste. (Do not recommend). My companion got the pork tacos with the pineapple salsa. The meat was very dry and wasn't well flavored. The salsa on top was good and the saving grace of the dish. She muscled down one of her tacos and didn't want to finish the rest. She also did not enjoy her meal. Twas gross. \n\nMaybe it was just an off day for them?

After I paid and stood in the line waiting for my latte, I talked with the employee who charged me: can I ask you a question? Why the latte today is $5? She explained: I thought what you want is old latte that is $5. I replied:  no, I just want regular latte. She said: ok, I can refund you 5 cent. I accepted the 5 cent and continued waiting for my latte. Few minutes later, another employee in the coffee shop gave me the so called old coffee and said something with another employee meaning I took advantage of this old latte. I explained The reason I accepted this so called old latte is just because I do not want to waste food. They already made the old latte, I feel if I do not accept it, they might just throw it or have to remake for me. Old latte or regular latte, I do not care. What I care more is the attitude. Especially, this is the place that I frequently go to. If this is Starbucks, I will say nothing. For you, this is just coffee, is just money.

As a registered company, all your information is public on Google. The reason I called your personal phone number instead of the number of the coffee shops is because I want to share my actual experience, as a loyal customer in the past, with the owner of the shop. \n\nSecond, I wrote the review here is not because I want to slam your business. As a once loyal customer, I just felt very sad with my experience and It\u2019s my freedom to share my experience. In addition, you said the review I wrote here slammed your business, but I would say your staff slammed my day. \n\nThird, you said I ran out of the cafe without taking the coffee! Yes! I did not take the coffee though I already paid it, but have you asked the staff why and can you explain here? \n\nLast, you said you refund the $5 for me that I rejected. At this moment or before I wrote the review here, I did not receive the money. \n\nAt this moment. All good!

The only thing remotely like a \"speakeasy\" is the curtain at the entrance, and pictures of women on the walls.\n\nSince our reservation was in Speakeasy, I went down to check in - we were about 20 minutes early so I wasn't expecting to get a seat immediately.\n\nI waited a few minutes near the bar/entrance where I noticed a family of 4 crowded & standing around a table. It looked like no one had approached them and they'd been waiting a while. Since no one seemed to be around to seat us (no host stand, no one paying attention to waiting patrons) I figured I'd go upstairs and ask the host there is thats where we needed to check in.\n\nThere were 2 women there, and was greeted upon entry which was nice. I let the host know that we were early but wanted to check if our table was available. She started scrolling to search, and I let her know the reservation was at Speakeasy. She stopped what she was looking for and told me I'd have to check in downstairs and pointed at where it was. I told her that there wasn't a host or anything there to seat us. Someone else came up, while there was still another host there, asking about changing to a booth and the host I was talking to started talking to her instead and ignoring that I was still standing there waiting for assistance. The other person could have easily handled it while who I was speaking with assisted me. Instead she chose to interject into another issue.\n\nFrustrated, I went back downstairs to take a better look in case I missed something. Still, no one. That same family standing around the table unsure of what to do and obviously still hadn't been approached.\n\nSo I went BACK upstairs and told her, still standing there, that there wasn't a host, we have a reservation for 5. So she stomps around me and leads me downstairs, where she grabs a tablet off of the bar, tells the family who had been waiting that they could sit, and waved at me to follow her.\n\nAfter seating us she stated she was the GM.

Every part of our day went spectacularly, exceeding our expectations, and a HUGE part of that was because of this venue and all the staff that make the place run smoothly, professionally, and joyfully.  I cannot tell you how many texts, emails, and voicemails we received afterwards telling us this was the best wedding they've ever been to.  How fun it was.  How the layout made it so cool and extra special.  They loved that dancing was separate, making that portion a real party.  And for the guests who don't really want to be out there dancing, they still felt like they were a part of it since the tables are right there in the action.  It was a dream. \nAlso, you will LOVE your experience at Deity as much as your guests did!  A few more specifics about our day, as I know I read all these reviews in detail when deciding; we started the day in the Suite getting ready, which was such a beautiful landing space to have.  It is GORGEOUS and just makes you feel luxurious and taken care of immediately.  The staff were checking in all day or answering texts about tiny questions.  And it was so nice to be whisked away up there at various points in the night for some connection time between you alone as a couple.  I think this aspect is something that sets Deity completely apart.  On the night of your event you are given TWO coordinators who are pretty much just there for you.  They keep track of timing and where you two need to be at any point in the night and just allowed us to be more fully present in every moment, not worrying over \"what time is it?  is xyz happening?\" At any moment I had a question or a thought, they were two steps ahead of me and I relaxed all the more, breathing a deep sigh of relief and gratitude.  Beyond these two amazing coordinators, there's the whole rest of the staff, who are also so kind, considerate, and on top of every little thing.  We had two people who were in a wheelchair or walker.  This was something that caused us a lot of concern beforehand, but Caio assured us they knew exactly how to handle it and to not worry.  And man were they right.  With grace, poise, and open hearts, they maneuvered the wheelchair over various steps, and aided with the chair lift.  My 96 year old grandma said she felt like royalty. They then went above and beyond when at the start of dancing, our wheelchair bound uncle couldn't get a cab as it was New Year's Eve, and the bartender himself walked him and his wife to the hotel!  When we heard of this the next morning, we teared up.  It was that level of kindness and consideration at every point, big and small, that sets this venue apart from all the rest.  \nThe food and drinks were plentiful and absolutely delicious (the salmon and short ribs are to die for) and kept us happy dancing into the night. Not to mention the GORGEOUS interior and design on every floor.  I loved it from the first time I set eyes on the place, and every guest commented how cool, unique, fun, and well-done our wedding was.  This was because of the team at Deity, not us.  ; )"}, {"text": "A beautiful place. I went there for a wedding and it was perfection. I loved the layout of the cocktail lounge, the ceremony/dining hall, and even the dance floor. It may be small but for a hidden gem in Brooklyn it has great atmosphere."}, {"text": "After we got engaged, we knew that finding a venue would be the first thing we needed to do. The venue really helps set the tone of how the event will come together. The owner of Deity, Caio, actually called us personally to follow up on our intake form. This simple act of such dedication and sincerity for his business was a refreshing surprise! We promptly set up time to tour the venue, which Caio promised to show us personally.\n\nIt was during that tour that the deal was really solidified. My now husband and I feel strongly about personal connections, and we felt that immediately with Caio. He had such a warm personality. We knew that we could trust him, and that this event would be taken personally as a reflection of his promise. It really made picking Deity a no brainer and we quickly locked in a date, and we are SO GLAD that we did. \n\nEverything, at every step and turn was truly amazing. I emailed Deity countless times with big and small questions. I am a huge planner, and needed to have every single detail sorted out, and the Deity staff was essentially my wedding planning co-team, it was an incredible partnership! They were more than helpful every step of the way, and even added additional advice whenever they could. When you\u2019re spending so much money, its difficult to feel at ease, or like you can really trust the process, but we really felt that way with Deity from the time we met Ciao, and especially on our wedding day.\n\nAnd this is all in the lead up to the event! The day-of was so smooth it was almost hard to believe that everything went off so incredibly seamlessly. The entire staff knew exactly what to do, when to do it, and how to handle every single aspect of our special day. We had a timeline to keep to, and they kept everyone on time without us feeling rushed or stressed. Whenever we needed something, or had a question that day, one of our 2 attendees were there to help, making it is so we could really just focus on the day, and the moment. \n\nThere is so much more that we could say, from helping us take special moments for ourselves, to the food and the incredible service, we could keep going on and on!! Truly, from the bottom of our hearts, thank you so much for making the day everything we could have imagined, and even more!!"}, {"text": "When ask about the venue, no response when i finally spoke to someone they were rude..."}], "types": ["bar", "food", "point_of_interest", "establishment"], "url": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=13667903410076053277", "user_ratings_total": 150}, {"formatted_address": "447 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10016, USA", "formatted_phone_number": "(212) 252-1972", "geometry": {"location": {"lat": 40.7435504, "lng": -73.979466}}, "name": "Eros", "price_level": 2, "rating": 4.3, "reviews": [{"text": "Food was very good.

I opted for the satay of chicken with peanut sauce. Great appetizer and fulfills the role of being a small dish with great flavor. Much too often, appetizers from restaurants can be as big as the main entree. 4-5 chicken pieces with an excellent peanut sauce. Highly recommend. I ordered the crispy orange chicken. Not much different from any other orange chicken. It was good, but nothing to really write home about. Outside skin crispy and with the rice, made for a good meal. I ordered the giant fortune cookie for dessert. Fruit is always a good idea for dessert. I usually get stuffed from the appetizer and entree, and any heavy chocolate is overbearing. The fortune cookie contains a fortune (yes, shocker I know) and is split between vanilla cream on one side and chocolate on the other. Along with the thick walls of the cookie, this made eating the desert easy and enjoyable. Also highly recommend. Now, I usually don't get tea after a meal however,  TAO had some flavored teas (I believe I tried peach flavor) which went excellently as the finisher to the meal.

The best thing I had was their cappuccino and my friend liked the cannoli. Portion sizes also seemed on the smaller side. We got a fancy asparagus dish worth 13-14 dollars and there were barely 8-9 stems of asparagus and just a powder of scrambled eggs - whereas from the description it seemed like there would be atleast two poached eggs on the side. I liked the olives in olive oil though. The service was okay except we had to ask for the free bread - it wasn\u2019t automatically kept on our table. Also our water was not refilled.  \n\nThis is a fancy place and for the price I expected better portions and more flavour - unfortunately I didn\u2019t get that. \n\nThis place does not serve halal. They do provide gluten and dairy free options on some of the dishes though so I thought that was nice."}], "types": ["bar", "restaurant", "food", "point_of_interest", "establishment"], "url": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=3243876427494599421", "user_ratings_total": 1030}, {"formatted_address": "202 W 14th St, New York, NY 10011, USA", "formatted_phone_number": "(646) 370-5331", "geometry": {"location": {"lat": 40.7386414, "lng": -74.0003049}}, "name": "Zusik", "rating": 4.6, "reviews": [{"text": "What is not to love in this food heaven?

This business could have done some positive alignment with a very popular TV show and blew it.  First they 1) advertised a special VIP entrance  if you texted or tweeted them.  It would be free if you entered before 11:30.  However, at 11:05, the line was around the block and when security staff was questioned about the promotion and shown the text message, I was sent to the back of the line with a smirk.  Later the line was solicited regularly by bouncers whose palms you could cross with $25-$40 to get to the front of the line, only to pay the cover charge ALSO upon entry.  \n\nAfter an hour and a half in line and explaining to the staff more than once that I was press AND was also on one of the performers' guestlists, I handed my business card to the people ahead of me in line when we started talking about my press cred.  THEY flagged a bouncer and explained the situation.  After an HOUR AND A HALF of standing on 8th Ave, I was finally ushered into the club by a ?manager\" with many apologies.  However, when I got inside and explained to the man at the desk that I was actually on a guestlist I was still soaked for FORTY DOLLARS.  \n\nFor my 40 samolians, I got one number from each of the headliners after waiting almost 3 hours for them to go on.  During that time I tried to find a spot to be comfortable, wandering over a sticky floor and being shoved by more than one aggressive patron who apparently failed to notice I'm not a teenager.  In fact I'm well over 35 so I don't push back too well. \n\nAfter the show, the complete lack of organization continued with security shoving me back up against the bar and continuing to tell me to move back.  Um honey that bar ain't goin' nowhere.  Then the way they directed the people in line?  I just kept getting pushed back further.  So I didn't get to thank the person who invited me & put me on their list.  The ?manager? did check in with me a few times during the night and I admit I failed to tell him about the $40 cover.  But he did nothing to insure that I connected with people there that I should have been given much easier access to.  \n\nIn short, I will never go back."}, {"text": "Am from bk nd razors its not a gay club but they take u likr u r check it out"}], "types": ["night_club", "point_of_interest", "establishment"], "url": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=12801489029709971593", "user_ratings_total": 13}, {"formatted_address": "156 Broadway, Brooklyn, NY 11211, USA", "formatted_phone_number": "(347) 599-0565", "geometry": {"location": {"lat": 40.7099878, "lng": -73.9631508}}, "name": "Davidoff of Geneva", "rating": 4.8, "reviews": [{"text": "I'm a complete novice when it comes to smoking cigars but I felt completely welcomed in this space.

Specifically in NY,  where the dating pool is so huge and competitive that no one really want to settle because there are just too many good choices.  Next one is ALWAYS better, so why settle?\n\nI made history with this date, I had in mind to bring my next date to this restaurant because I loved the restaurant,  the food and their specialty the Mapple French Toast Doughnut. I knew that whoever I brought here, was going to love it too. Indeed,  I impressed him very much. You know, I do my research for my dating game, I make sure whoever I meet, is going to have one of the best time or dates in his dating history, otherwise,  why bother taking someone out, is all about the connection and experience,  wink, wink...\n\nI saw an online article with the picture of their Mapple French Toast Doughnut and it looked tasty so I was very curious to try it. They say \"Don't judge a book by its cover\" well, I could judge the food by its picture. Omg! Do not die before tasting the Mapple French Toast Doughnut from this place #thankmelater.  This is one of a kind dessert,  it just taste so good and I got food high again, is a unique sweet soft taste, not too sweet just right. For my first visit,  I brought my son here and we both loved it. For my second visit I brought two friends and they also loved it. This place makes me feel at home, the Owner is so cool and friendly,  he welcomed me and my friends.  Carlos the waiter is also great with customer service, I asked him for soft red wine and he gave me one that was just perfect for the night.\n\nThe calm Aura of this restaurant makes it a perfect place to have a beer after work (done that), also the fact that  is not overcrowded makes it an excellent place to go.  The lighting at night set the tone for a highly Romantic Aura. My date loved that it wasn't over crowded or noisy as well. So there you go, I just published one of my top local spots for just about any type of meeting.\n\nAs for my date, he was the perfect man, Military training,  extremely Smart, 13 years of fighting technique experience,  he is a killing machine without a weapon,  yet not dangerous.  A mindful man, under control with an extreme inner sense of control.  The deal breaker,  he wants children and I don't.\n\nThe End."}, {"text": "I had a dinner salad and restaurant week menu.

It would have been at least a courtesy if we got a call saying that he is late or apologize for not coming due to a car issue. But instead we received such rude behavior. I called at least 4 times and no confirmation or update if someone was indeed coming.

Another language discrepancy was that I asked \"Are my left overs packed?  Is the spinach there.\" to which the server ordered another spinach dish.  Annoying, but not painfully so.  Based on this, I would recommend Bagatelle, especially for Sunday Brunch, at which point it is a zoo of beautiful people, and loud music, a far cry from the intimate dinner I attended."}], "types": ["bar", "restaurant", "food", "point_of_interest", "establishment"], "url": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=14667603741755056069", "user_ratings_total": 768}, {"formatted_address": "97 Bowery, New York, NY 10002, USA", "formatted_phone_number": "(212) 925-8083", "geometry": {"location": {"lat": 40.7173708, "lng": -73.99505479999999}}, "name": "Sup Crab", "rating": 4.1, "reviews": [{"text": "We got the King crab cooked three ways.

Even though I was a solo diner, the staffs were incredibly amazing, making me feel welcome immediately. I made reservation two days beforehand via email which was quick and easy. Upon my arrival, they took my coat and showed me my seat. When ordering, I asked the staff what he recommended and he said to try the tasting course. It was that moment the journey started. What I though was a 5-course meal became 7 to 9. Keep in mind that each course has a specific wine that pairs with it. While I don't know the names and specific details of what I ate, I will do my best to describe them. But please look at my pictures to get an idea of the courses. The first course was the caviar and clam appetizer. It was my first time eating caviar and I was highly impressed. The sauce complimented the caviar very well. The bread and spread for me to nibble on while waiting for the next course was so good. Another dish I got was flat crepe-like dish that was surprisely filling and tasty. There was a meat dish that came with a slice layer of duck meat that was a joy to my taste bud. By now I was getting full but the courses kept coming. For dessert, the chocolate raspberry mousse cake was so good. While enjoying my dessert, the staffs surprised me with a chocolate cake with a lit candle. It was totally unexpected and extremely nice gesture. I was not able to finish all my desserts, so the staff put them in a box for me to take home.\n\nAll in all, a short version of this review is that Benno is amazing. I highly recommend it especially for a nice occassion like a birthday or anniversary. The food was great. The wine selection was perfect pairing for each meal.

It is hard to get your waiters attention when sitting at a counter also.  Generally, love Todd English restaurants, and have been to many of them. Not sure about this one. Ordered the rigatoni bolognese. The bowl it comes in makes it feel very small, compared to when you see this sprawling salad served to the person next to you. The bolognese sauce is interesting in flavor....tastes like maybe there is nutmeg or something a little non traditional in it.  It was good, but the flavor is a bit tinny, reminding me of spaghettios, and didn't have a rich tomato bolognese flavor like many others I've had in my lifetime.

We stopped in at 7:30 on a Friday night, with no reservations, and the staff went out of their way to find a place for the four of us.  \n\nWe started out with baby artichokes that were pan roasted in olive oil and served with thin crispy slices of garlic chips and small unpitted olives.  Delicious.  The artichokes were tender and the hearts had that perfect creamy consistency once you started chewing on them, the garlic chips were sweet and mild,  and the olives added the perfect sharpness to each bite.  What a treat. \n\nNow..... my main course was so tasty and savory that I actually passed up desert because I didn't want to introduce any new flavors to my palette. \n\nI had the rigatoni cipullo. A plate of perfectly done, al dante rigatoni in a light cream sauce with blended sweet sausage, prosciutto, onions and a touch of cinnamon.  Don't be fooled,  when you see the meat in the description you might think there would be chunks of meat tossed into the light cream sauce,  and you would be wrong.  The meat is pureed with the cream sauce and the cinnamon, creating this silky sauce of love that I wanted to bury my face in.  Instead, what I actually did was carefully slide two rigatoni onto the fork tines through the holes, and slowly savored each bite until there were only six rigatoni left, and stopped, because I was just at that place where I felt like I was floating. Just full enough to be satisfied, and at the point where I knew that if I had eaten the last six, it would have pushed me over that edge where I would have felt that uncomfortable fullness,  and I didn't want to risk anything detracting from how satisfied and comfortable I felt. This was one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. \n\nWonderfully warm and accommodating staff,  delicious original recipes, and extremely reasonably priced.  The trifecta of a perfect meal on the Upper East side of Manhattan. \n\nP.S. my dinner mates had tagliatelle alla bolognese, linguine alla vongole (white clam sauce), and pasta with sauce that they all raved about, but honestly, as good as they thought their dishes were,  there's just no way they were as good as mine. \n\nMangia e divertiti (eat and enjoy)"}, {"text": "We were lucky enough to sit outside on a beautiful night and enjoy delicious food."}], "types": ["bar", "restaurant", "food", "point_of_interest", "establishment"], "url": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=15375949242051658057", "user_ratings_total": 74}, {"formatted_address": "85 Orchard St, New York, NY 10002, USA", "formatted_phone_number": "(212) 925-7355", "geometry": {"location": {"lat": 40.71805419999999, "lng": -73.990376}}, "name": "Dudley's", "price_level": 2, "rating": 4.4, "reviews": [{"text": "Great place to have brunch!

It took over 45 minutes to serve us. The first ones served were finished eating, before the last were served. This was probablyy because they only assigned one waiter to handle our entire table. They brought us out warm plates for the steak but by the time the steak came, the plates were cold.  The last two served, received the following comment from the waiter \"you asked for medium well, it takes longer to cook\". Yeah, but not 45 minutes. As far as the food, slightly below what you would expect from a top NYC steakhouse. The Porterhouse was cooked perfectly but a little short on flavor. The creamed spinach wasn't creamed. The sweet potato fries were excellent, however, the couple sitting next to us were eating regular fries and complaining about how salty they were.

My wife and I had the mashed potatoes and wedge salad which seemed fine.  The service was top-notch and they were completely attentive to our needs.

The Chef is clearly at the top of his game and is striving to push himself to the absolute pinnacle of his abilities.

Arriving is like discovering a hidden gem tucked away in Brooklyn just across and down and to the left of the Brooklyn Bridge when approaching from Manhattan, the location is stunning and absolutely perfect, it is clear immediately that is no accident. Upon entering the boldness of the largely black interior floods your vision, I would say a minimalistic design by someone that understands how to execute on this style. The black is expertly used to bring focus to the beauty and elegance of simple well executed pieces throughout the space. The quality of the chairs and clear effort that must have went into making them, the sign itself, the menu. Minimalistic designs can be pretty severe in nature, harsh, slanted towards extremely plain, when well executed they bring focus to simple things done extraordinarily well, the beauty of a wood grain, the complexity in the design of a table or chair, the simple yet complex exposed kitchen. The staff, top notch, fun, execute with precision with a common mission of exceeding expectations. We had the chance to meet the chef briefly, as expected, almost a bit introverted, likely thinking about how to infuse magic into his next creation, likely a genius, certainly an impressive, humble, yet confident person, exudes passion. The food, my review is already too long but oh my, to say I was exasperated with delight would be an understatement to the extreme. The food, for lack of a better term, was perfect. If I had one meal I could pick as my last, aska would currently fill that position. One can only hope in a lifetime I can find its equal, if I didn't, I wouldn't be disappointed, as close to the perfect dining experience I've ever had.

We ordered the jumbo pretzel, BBQ boneless wings, BBQ regular chicken wings, and the loaded tater tots. The food was delicious BBQ on wings was on the sweet side which is my personal preference and meat was juicy and portion was more then enough for one person. Tater tots were my favorite nice golden crunchy exterior loaded with beer cheese bacon and scallions, great dish to share with 2-3 people. The pretzel looked good but tasted like cardboard and beer cheese was not hot enough, would skip. They had an extensive alcohol menu and service was very friendly and attentive. All together tab was fair for amount of food and quality and tip was included so make sure you read the receipt.

I\u2019ve eaten a lot of paella and it just seemed a little weird that it wasn\u2019t mixed into the dish or a little more abundant in seafood, or at least dressed up to look nicer. In our whole time there no one came to refill our drinks, see how we were doing, ask how our food was or anything. We were visited to have our order taken and to accept payment.

When my guests opted to just have cappuccinos, our server looked at me, rolled his eyes, and said \"You should have told me you were just having coffee.\" He then made a big show of removing the silverware and plates from our table. Keep in mind: the dining room was completely empty. I was so shocked that I stammered our an apology, but also asked how I was supposed to know in advance what my guests wanted. After they left, I asked to speak to the server, Matt. He offered a perfunctory apology after much discussion. My guests had earlier remarked on how nice the menu looked, and their plans to come back. Now, I doubt they will return, and I don't think I will, either."}, {"text": "Had dinner with a friend who lives in the neighborhood. I had a big plate of spaghetti and meatballs.

Which is fine, but as a Bengali myself, there's still very little representation of the Bengali culture, so it would've been nice if they advertised as a Bengali restaurant instead of Indian, and embraced more traditional Bengali food. But I guess advertising it as \"Indian\" sells more\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"}, {"text": "Food is really delicious , can\u2019t say any bad word about it.
